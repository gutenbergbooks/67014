</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> cry is everywhere the same—the badness
of our modern servants. But who is really to
blame—the mistresses or the maids? the masters
or the employed? The one class are educated, the
other are comparatively ignorant; and influence
filters downwards—it does not permeate the
social mass from below. We cast longing looks
backward to the bygone times when servants
were the humble friends of the family, ready
to serve for love and bare maintenance if bad
times came, and identifying themselves with the
fortunes of their masters. But we forget that
we ourselves have changed even more than
they, since the days when mistresses overlooked
the maids in closer companionship than is warranted
now by the conditions of society—when
daily details were ordered by the lady, and the
execution of her orders was personally supervised—when
housekeeping was at once an art
and a pleasure, a science and a source of pride.
Then young servants were trained immediately
under the eye of the mistress and by her direct
influence; as now they are trained under the
head servant of their special department. And
in this change of teachers alone, if no other
cause were wanting, we could trace the source of
the deterioration complained of.</p>

<p>The lady who, two generations ago, taught
the still-room maid the mysteries of sirups
and confections, of jams and jellies and dainty
sweetmeats—who knew the prime joints, and the
signs of good meat, tender poultry, and fresh
fish, as well as the cook herself—who could go
blindfold to her linen press and pick out the
best sheets from the ordinary, and knew by
place as well as by touch where the finer huckaback
towels were to be found and where the
coarser—who could check as well as instruct
the housemaid at every turn—such a mistress
as this, for her own part diligent, refined, truthful,
God-fearing, was likely to give a higher
tone, infuse a more faithful and dutiful spirit
into her servants, than is possible now, when
the thing is reduced to a profession like any
other, and the teacher is only technically, not
morally, in advance of the pupil. It is the
mistresses who have let the reins slip from their
hands, not the maids who have taken the bit
between their teeth; or, rather, the latter has
been in consequence of the former; and when
we blame our servants for the ‘heartlessness’
of their service—for the ease with which they
throw up their situations, on the sole plea of
want of change, or of bettering themselves, to the
infinite disturbance of things and trouble to the
household—we must remember that we ourselves
first broke the golden links, and that to expect
devotion without giving affection is to expect
simply slavishness. The advantage of the present
system of mere professional and skilled
technicality is to be found in the greater comfort
and regularity of the household; in the
more finished precision and perfection of the
service; in the more complete systemisation of
the whole art and practice of attendance. But
these gains have been bought with a price—not
only in the increased cost of housekeeping,
but in the deterioration of the moral character
of servants, and in the annihilation of the friendly
and quasi-family feeling which once existed
between the mistress and her domestics.</p>

<p>In large cities and in the houses of the rich,
the upper men-servants are practically their own
masters. They make their own stipulations as
to hours, food, allowances, liberties; and compound
for the nervous exhaustion of perpetual
worry which does not include hard work, by
a scale of feeding which is more savage than
civilised, in the quantity of flesh-meat included.
They can make the house pleasant or
intolerable to a guest; and in a thousand
sly mysterious ways they cause the mistress
annoyances which cannot be brought home to
them, and of which they enjoy the effect produced.
In the kitchen, the cook is absolute
mistress, and holds her lady as merely the
superscriber of her own <i>menu</i> for the day, as
well as the bank whence is drawn the money<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">{82}</span>
for the bills—which she pays. And in the payment
of those bills, as well as in dealing with
remnants—of which woe betide the mistress who
should recommend the home consumption!—the
cook doubles and trebles her wages, and feathers
her own nest with the down plucked from her
employers. Can we wonder at this? We put
a half-educated person into a place of trust and
temptation; we neither check nor overlook her;
we trust all to her abstract honesty and sense
of justice; there is no danger of discovery, still
less of punishment; she has before her the additional
temptation of pleasing her fellow-servants
with whom she lives in hourly contact, rather
than of saving the pockets of her rich employers
whom she scarcely knows and rarely sees; and
then we lift up our hands at the depravity of
human nature, when we find that the tradesmen
give back a percentage on their bills, and that
whole pounds of wax candles swell the perquisite
of the grease-pot handsomely. But next door,
the rich merchant is a fraudulent bankrupt; the
respectable family lawyer over the way absconds
after having dealt with his clients’ securities;
master’s friend, the banker, puts up the shutters
to the ruin of thousands on thousands, while
his wife has a secured jointure which enables
them to live in princely style; and the stockjobber,
who dines with us on Sundays, makes
use of private information to sell to his best
friend shares which, up to their highest point
to-day, he knows will collapse like a burst
balloon to-morrow. Are we not a little hard
on the kitchen, seeing what is done in the
parlour?</p>

<p>Go from the rich to the poor among our gentry—from
the gilded upper stratum to the lower
base and barren subsoil—and here again we find
that mistresses are as much to blame as the maids,
whose shortcomings they bewail and resent. In
a household of this kind, the <i>res angusta domi</i>
prevents the hiring, because rendering impossible
the payment, of good and well-trained servants;
and the mistress has to be content with young
girls whom she must teach, and whose untutored
services she buys at small cost. But here, again,
the modern spirit of the age spoils what else
might seem to be a return to old and wholesome
conditions. Nine times out of ten, the mistress
is as incapable of teaching as the maid is slow
of learning; for we must remember that untrained
girls of this sort are generally taken
from the most humble class, and that they come
into service with but little natural brightness of
wit and less educational sharpening. The mistress
expects too much from them. For the most part
aching under her own burden, disliking her
duties, and envying her richer sisters, she does
the least she can in the house, and gives the
heavy end of the stick to the hired help. And,
forgetful of the maxim of ‘line upon line and
precept upon precept,’ and of the necessity of
reiteration, patient and continual, if a dull brain
has to be impressed and a new method learned,
she is impatient and angry when orders are
forgotten—ways of doing things bungled—and
chaos, disorder, and confusion are the result.
Perhaps she herself is unpunctual and inexact;
but she expects from her seventeen-old little
Betty the punctuality of the sun and the regularity
of the clock. Perhaps she herself is
undutiful, and shirks all that she can transfer
on to another’s hands; but she looks for devotion,
self-sacrifice, the unfailing performance of
her duty, from this comparative child, and
feels entitled to sit in the seat of the judge,
when these virtues run dry and the shallow
stream of conscientiousness fails. From the
nurse-girl, herself a mere child, hired to wheel
the perambulator and look after the children, she
expects such patience, forbearance, and understanding
of child-nature, as she herself, mother
as she is, cannot command. If Jacky is rude and
Jenny is rebellious, if Tommy is unmanageable
and Katie is defiant, she, the mother, whose temper
would be in a blaze on the moment, demands
that the nursemaid shall bear all with a calm
and equable mind, and, without the power of punishing,
be able to reduce to obedience these little
rebels, whom she herself cannot always control
with the help of the rod and the dark-closet to
boot. Furthermore, she lays the blame of these
naughty tempers on the girl, to excuse the children.
They are always good with <i>her</i>, she says
angrily, and it must be Mary’s fault that they
are so often tiresome when <i>she</i> has them. And
when she says this, she does not remember the
old adage about the little pitchers and long ears,
and never realises the fact that by her own words
she gives the children their cue, and encourages
them to be rude to one who, they know beforehand,
will be made the scapegoat for their sins.
That overpowering maternal love—that <i>storgë</i>, of
which poets make so much account, and which
is the primal necessity for the preservation of the
race—is at times the cause of great injustice,
especially when dealing with those unprotected
young nursemaids to whom no authority can be
given, from whom all controlling influence is
expected, and who have neither moral force nor
mental enlightenment enough to control themselves,
still less others. If they stand in the
attitude of accusers, the mother rejects them as
traducers.</p>

<p>Sometimes, in small households, the master
interferes like a woman, and adds to the confusion
by putting his masculine fingers into the
already over-stocked domestic pie. There are
men who are simply maddening in a house.
They watch behind the window-blind and count
the number of seconds Betty gives to the baker’s
boy, and how she smirks and smiles at the
handsome young greengrocer or the smart Mr
Butcher. That Betty should have any pleasure
in the gallant words or flattering looks of one or
all of these, seems to them a sin, a dereliction of
duty, and, in some queer way, a wrong and a
robbery done to them. For were they to be
completely candid, most masters and mistresses
would say that they expected the whole of a
servant’s nature to be given to them—all her
thoughts as well as her abilities—all her interests
as well as all her time; and that to fall in love
is a kind of petty treason and a quasi-dishonest
transfer of energy. Put in this crude way, this
theorem would be denied; and a dozen other
reasons would be given for the confessed dislike
felt by employers for a love-sick maid. Reduced
to its elements, it would come to what we have
said—impatience of the inevitable troubler of the
conditions being one of the proofs on our side.
In matters of this kind, the ‘molly-man,’ who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">{83}</span>
stays at home, peeps from behind the blind and
puts his fingers into all the pies aboard, is a
harsher and less sympathetic person to deal with
than is the average mistress, to whom a girl’s
love affairs carry an echo that awakens old
dreams in her own soul and gain a little compassion
for the sufferer. For, after all, Betty’s
love for the baker’s young man is very much
the same kind of thing as Ada’s for the captain
and Mabel’s for the curate; and neither the cut
nor the material of the gown influences the
beating of the heart which throbs beneath!</p>

<p>In all this, as we had occasion in a recent paper
to observe, we do not excuse the faulty side of
modern servants, but we should like to see inaugurated
a better method of dealing with it. We
should like to see the mistresses go back to the
old friendly feeling and friendly intercourse with
those who live under their roof, and make their
happiness, by the conscientious discharge of duty—that
old friendly feeling which made of the
household one family, and brought the servants
in line with the masters by the golden cord of
human sympathy. People say that this is impossible;
that the spirit of the age prevents it; that
servants themselves refuse to recognise anything
like personal interest from their employers; that
the whole tone and character of service are
changed, and that it is now only a profession,
where the employed live under the roof of their
employers, instead of out of the house, as with
mill-hands and the like. It may be so; but
if even so, we contend that the higher natures
could influence the lower if they would; that
knowledge could direct ignorance; and that it
depends on the masters and mistresses to get
good out of these changed conditions—human
nature, on the whole, seeking the light, and
society, like a broken crystal, mending its fractures
with fresh material, to the maintenance of
form and beauty.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> morning when Edward and Marian were
to start on their voyage to Trinidad, with Nora
in their charge, was a beautifully clear, calm, and
sunny one. The tiny steam-tender that took
them down Southampton Water, from the landing-stage
to the moorings where the big ocean-going
Severn lay at anchor, ploughed her way merrily
through the blue ripplets that hardly broke the
level surface. Though it was a day of parting,
nobody was over-sad. General Ord had come
down with Marian, his face bronzed with twenty
years of India, but straight and erect still like
a hop-pole, as he stood with his tall thin figure
lithe and steadfast on the little quarter-deck. Mrs
Ord was there too, crying a little, of course,
as is only decorous on such occasions, yet not
more so than a parting always demands from the
facile eyes of female humanity. Marian didn’t
cry much, either; she felt so safe in going with
Edward, and hoped to be back so soon again on
a summer visit to her father and mother. As for
Nora, Nora was always bright as the sunshine,
and could never see anything except the bright
side of things. ‘We shall take such care of dear
Marian in Trinidad, Mrs Ord!’ she said gaily.
‘You’ll see her home again on a visit in another
twelvemonth, with more roses on her cheek than
she’s got now, when she’s had a taste of our
delicious West Indian mountain air.’</p>

<p>‘And if Trinidad suits Miss Ord—Mrs Hawthorn,
I mean—dear me, how stupid of me!’
Harry Noel put in quietly, ‘half as well as it
seems to have suited you, Miss Dupuy, we shall
have no cause to complain of Hawthorn for
having taken her out there.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, no fear of that,’ Nora answered, smiling
one of her delicious childish smiles. ‘You don’t
know how delightful Trinidad is, Mr Noel; it’s
really one of the most charming places in all
Christendom.’</p>

<p>‘On your recommendation, then,’ Harry answered,
bowing slightly and looking at her with
eyes full of meaning, ‘I shall almost be tempted
to go out some day and see for myself how really
delightful are these poetical tropics of yours.’</p>

<p>Nora blushed, and her eyes fell slightly. ‘You
would find them very lovely, no doubt, Mr Noel,’
she answered, more demurely and in a half-timid
fashion; ‘but I can’t recommend them, you
know, with any confidence, because I was such
a very little girl when I first came home to
England. You had better not come out to
Trinidad merely on the strength of my recommendation.’</p>

<p>Harry bowed his head again gravely. ‘As you
will,’ he said. ‘Your word is law. And yet,
perhaps some day, I shouldn’t be surprised if
Hawthorn and Mrs Hawthorn were to find me
dropping in upon them unexpectedly for a scratch
dinner. After all, it’s a mere nothing nowadays
to run across the millpond, as the Yankees call
it.’</p>

<p>They reached the <i>Severn</i> about an hour before
the time fixed for starting, and sat on deck
talking together with that curious sense of finding
nothing to say which always oppresses one on
the eve of a long parting. It seems as though
no subject of conversation sufficiently important
for the magnitude of the occasion ever occurred
to one: the mere everyday trivialities of ordinary
talk sound out of place at such a serious moment.
So, by way of something to do, the party soon
began to institute a series of observations upon
Edward and Marian’s fellow-passengers, as they
came on board, one after another, in successive
batches on the little tender.</p>

<p>‘Just look at that brown young man!’ Nora
cried, in a suppressed whisper, as a tall and
gentlemanly looking mulatto walked up the gangway
from the puffing tug. ‘We shall be positively
overwhelmed with coloured people, I
declare! There are three Hottentot Venuses down
in the saloon already, bound for Haiti; and a
San Domingo general, as black as your hat; and
a couple of walnut-coloured old gentlemen going
to Dominica. And now, here’s another regular
brown man coming on board to us. What’s his
name, I wonder? Oh, there it is, painted as large
as life upon his portmanteau! “Dr Whitaker,
Trinidad.” Why, my dear, he’s actually going
the whole way with us. And a doctor too! goodness
gracious. Just fancy being attended through
fever by a man of that complexion!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">{84}</span></p>

<p>‘Oh, hush, Nora!’ Marian cried, in genuine
alarm. ‘He’ll overhear you, and you’ll hurt
his feelings. Besides, you oughtn’t to talk so
about other people, whether they hear you or
whether they don’t.’</p>

<p>‘Hurt his feelings, my dear! O dear, no, not
a bit of it. I know them better than you do.
My dear Marian, these people haven’t got any
feelings; they’ve been too much accustomed to
be laughed at from the time they were babies,
ever to have had the chance of acquiring any.’</p>

<p>‘Then the more shame,’ Edward interrupted
gravely, ‘to those who have laughed them out
of all self-respect and natural feeling. But I
don’t believe, for my part, there’s anybody on
earth who doesn’t feel hurt at being ridiculed.’</p>

<p>‘Ah, that’s so nice of you to think and talk
like that, Mr Hawthorn,’ Nora answered frankly;
‘but you won’t think so, you know, I’m quite
certain, after you’ve been a month or two on
shore over in Trinidad.’</p>

<p>‘Good-morning, ladies and gentlemen,’ the
captain of the <i>Severn</i> put in briskly, walking
up to them as they lounged in a group on
the clean-scrubbed quarter-deck—‘good-morning,
ladies and gentlemen. Fine weather to start on
a voyage. Are you all going with us?—Why,
bless my heart, if this isn’t General Ord! I
sailed with you, sir, fifteen years ago now or
more, must be, when I was a second officer
in the P. and O. service.—You don’t remember
me; no, I daresay not; I was only a second
officer then, and you sat at the captain’s table.
But I remember you, sir—I remember you.
There’s more folks know Tom Fool, the proverb
says, than Tom Fool knows; and no offence
meant, general, nor none be taken. And so
you’re going out with us now, are you?—going
out with us now? Well, you’ll sit at
the captain’s table still, sir, no doubt, you and
your party; and as I’m the captain now,
you see, why, I shall have a better chance
than I used to have of making your acquaintance.’</p>

<p>The captain laughed heartily as he spoke at
his own small wit; but General Ord drew himself
up rather stiffly, and answered in a somewhat
severe tone: ‘No, I’m not going out with
you this journey myself; but my daughter,
who has lately married, and her husband here,
are just setting out to their new home over
in Trinidad.’</p>

<p>‘In Trinidad,’ the jolly captain echoed heartily—‘in
Trinidad! Well, well, beautiful island,
beautiful, beautiful! Must mind they don’t take
too much mainsheet, or catch yellow Jack, or
live in the marshes, that’s all; otherwise, they’ll
find it a delightful residence. I took out a
young sub-lieutenant, just gazetted, last voyage
but two, when they had the yellow Jack awfully
bad up at cantonments. He was in a deadly
funk of the fever all the way, and always asking
everybody questions about it. The moment he
landed, who does he go and meet but an old
Irish friend of the family, who was going home
by the return steamer. The Irishman rushes
up to him and shakes his hand violently and
says he—“Me dear fellow,” says he, “ye’ve come
in the very nick of time. Promotion’s certain;
they’re dying by thousands. Every day, wan
of ’em drops off the list; and all ye’ve got to
do is to hould yer head up, keep from drinking
any brandy, and don’t be frightened; and, be
George, ye’ll rise in no time as fast as I have;
and I’m going home this morning a colonel.”’</p>

<p>The general shuddered slightly. ‘Not a pleasant
introduction to the country, certainly,’ he
answered in his driest manner. ‘But I suppose
Trinidad’s fairly healthy at present?’</p>

<p>‘Healthy! Well, yes, well enough as the
tropics go, general.—But don’t you be afraid of
your young people. With health and strength,
they’ll pull through decently, not a doubt of
it.—Let me see—let me see; I must secure ’em
a place at my own table. We’ve got rather an
odd lot of passengers this time, mostly; a good
many of ’em have got a very decided touch o’
the tar-brush about ’em—a touch o’ the tar-brush.
There’s that woolly-headed nigger fellow
over there who’s just come aboard; he’s going
to Trinidad too; he’s a doctor, he is. We
mustn’t let your people get mixed up with all
that lot, of course; I’ll keep ’em a place nice
and snug at my own table.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you,’ the general said, rather more
graciously than before.—‘This is my daughter,
captain, Mrs Hawthorn. And this is my son-in-law,
Mr Edward Hawthorn, who’s going out
to accept a district judgeship over yonder in
Trinidad.’</p>

<p>‘Ha!’ the jovial captain answered in his bluff
voice, doffing his hat sailor-fashion to Marian
and Edward. ‘Going to hang up the niggers
out in Trinidad, are you, sir? Going to hang
up the niggers! Well, well, they deserve it all,
every man-Jack of ’em, the lazy beggars; they
all deserve hanging. A pestering set of idle,
thieving, hulking vagabonds, as ever came around
to coal a ship in harbour! I’d judge ’em, I
would—I’d judge ’em.’ And the captain pantomimically
expressed the exact nature of his
judicial sentiments by pressing his own stout
bull-neck, just across the windpipe, with his
sturdy right hand, till his red and sunburnt face
grew even redder and redder with the suggested
suspension.</p>

<p>Edward smiled quietly, but answered nothing.</p>

<p>‘Well, sir,’ the captain went on as soon as he
had recovered fully from the temporary effects
of his self-inflicted strangulation, ‘and have you
ever been in the West Indies before, or is this
your first visit?’</p>

<p>‘I was born there,’ Edward answered. ‘I’m
a Trinidad man by birth; but I’ve lived so long
in England, and went there so young, that I
don’t really recollect very much about my native
country.’</p>

<p>‘Mr Hawthorn’s father you may know by
name,’ the general said, a little assertively. ‘He
is a son of the Honourable James Hawthorn, of
Agualta Estate, Trinidad.’</p>

<p>The captain drew back for a moment with a
curious look, and scanned Edward closely from
head to foot with a remarkably frank and maritime
scrutiny; then he whistled low to himself
for a few seconds, and seemed to be ruminating
inwardly upon some very amusing and unusual
circumstance. At last he answered slowly, in
a more reserved and somewhat embarrassed tone:
‘O yes, I know Mr Hawthorn of Agualta—know
him personally; well-known man, Mr Hawthorn
of Agualta. Member of the Legislative Council<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">{85}</span>
of the island. Fine estate, Agualta—very fine
estate indeed, and has one of the largest outputs
of rum and sugar anywhere in the whole
West Indies.’</p>

<p>‘I told you so,’ Harry Noel murmured parenthetically.
‘The governor is coiny. They’re all
alike, the whole breed of them. Secretiveness
large, acquisitiveness enormous, benevolence and
generosity absolutely undeveloped. When you
get to Trinidad, my dear Teddy, bleed him, bleed
him!’</p>

<p>‘Well, well, Mrs Hawthorn,’ the captain said
gallantly to Marian, who stood by rather wondering
what his sudden change of demeanour could
possibly portend, ‘you shall have a seat at my
table—certainly, certainly; you shall have a seat
at my table. The general’s an old passenger of
mine on the P. and O.; and I’ve known Mr
Hawthorn of Agualta Estate ever since I first
came upon the West India liners.—And the
young lady, is she going too?’ For Captain
Burford, like most others of his craft, had a
quick eye for pretty faces, and he had not been
long in picking out and noticing Nora’s.</p>

<p>‘This is Miss Dupuy of Orange Grove,’ Marian
said, drawing her young companion a little
forward. ‘Perhaps you know her father too, as
you’ve been going so long to the island.’</p>

<p>‘What! a daughter of Mr Theodore Dupuy of
Orange Grove and Pimento Valley,’ the captain
replied briskly. ‘Mr Theodore Dupuy’s daughter!
Lord bless my soul, Mr Theodore Dupuy! O
yes, don’t I just know him! Why, Mr Dupuy’s
one of the most respected and well-known
gentlemen in the whole island. Been settled at
Orange Grove, the Dupuys have, ever since the
old Spanish occupation.—And so you’re taking
out Mr Theodore Dupuy’s daughter, are you,
Mrs Hawthorn? Well, well! Taking out Mr—Theodore
Dupuy’s daughter. That’s a capital
joke, that is.—O yes, you must all sit at the
head of my table, ladies; and I’ll do everything
that lies in my power to make you comfortable.’</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Edward and Harry Noel had
strolled off for a minute towards the opposite
end of the deck, where the mulatto gentleman
was standing quite alone, looking down steadily
into the deep-blue motionless water. As the
captain moved away, Nora Dupuy gave a little
start, and caught Marian Hawthorn’s arm excitedly
and suddenly. ‘Look there!’ she cried—‘oh,
look there, Marian! Do you see Mr Hawthorn?
Do you see what he’s doing? That brown man
over there, with the name on the portmanteau,
has turned round and spoken to him, and Mr
Hawthorn’s actually held out his hand and is
shaking hands with him!’</p>

<p>‘Well,’ Marian answered in some surprise, ‘I
see he is. Why not?’</p>

<p>‘Why not? My dear, how can you ask me
such a question! Why, of course, because the
man’s a regular mulatto—a coloured person.’</p>

<p>Marian laughed. ‘Really, dear,’ she answered,
more amused than angry, ‘you mustn’t be
so entirely filled up with your foolish little
West Indian prejudices. The young man’s a
doctor, and no doubt a gentleman in education
and breeding, and, for my part, I can’t for the
life of me see why one shouldn’t shake hands
with him as well as with any other respectable
person.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, but Marian, you know—a brown man!—his
father and mother!—the associations—no,
really!’</p>

<p>Marian smiled again. ‘They’re coming this
way,’ she said; ‘we shall soon hear what they’re
talking about. Perhaps he knows something
about your people, or Edward’s.’</p>

<p>Nora looked up quite defiant. ‘About <i>my</i>
people, Marian!’ she said almost angrily. ‘Why,
what can you be thinking of! You don’t suppose,
do you, that <i>my</i> people are in the habit of
mixing casually with woolly-headed mulattoes?’</p>

<p>She had hardly uttered the harsh words, when
the mulatto gentleman walked over towards them
side by side with Edward Hawthorn, and lifted
his hat courteously to Marian.</p>

<p>‘My wife,’ Edward said, as Marian bowed
slightly in return: ‘Dr Whitaker.’</p>

<p>‘I saw your husband’s name upon his boxes,
Mrs Hawthorn,’ the mulatto gentleman said with
a pleasant smile, and in a soft, clear, cultivated
voice; ‘and as my father has the privilege of
knowing Mr Hawthorn of Agualta, over in Trinidad,
I took the liberty of introducing myself at
once to him. I’m glad to hear that we’re to
be fellow-passengers together, and that your husband
has really decided to return at last to his
native island.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you,’ Marian answered simply. ‘We
are all looking forward much to our life in
Trinidad.’ Then, with a little mischievous
twinkle in her eye, she turned to Nora. ‘This
is another of our fellow-passengers, Dr Whitaker,’
she said demurely—‘my friend, Miss Dupuy,
whom I’m taking out under my charge—another
Trinidadian: you ought to know one another.
Miss Dupuy’s father lives at an estate called
Orange Grove—isn’t it, Nora?’</p>

<p>The mulatto doctor lifted his hat again, and
bowed with marked politeness to the blushing
white girl. For a second, their eyes met. Dr
Whitaker’s looked at the beautiful half-childish
face with unmistakable instantaneous admiration.
Nora’s flashed a little angrily, and her nostrils
dilated with a proud quiver; but she said never
a word; she merely gave a chilly bow, and didn’t
attempt even to offer her pretty little gloved
hand to the brown stranger.</p>

<p>‘I have heard of Miss Dupuy’s family by name,’
the mulatto answered, speaking to Marian, but
looking askance at the same time toward the
petulant Nora. ‘Mr Dupuy of Orange Grove is
well known throughout the island. I am glad
that we are going to have so much delightful
Trinidad society on our outward passage.’</p>

<p>‘Thank him for nothing,’ Nora murmured aside
to Harry Noel, moving away as she spoke towards
Mrs Ord at the other end of the vessel. ‘What
impertinence! Marian ought to have known
better than to introduce me to him.’</p>

<p>‘It’s a pity you don’t like the coloured gentleman,’
Harry Noel put in provokingly. ‘The
appreciation is unfortunately not mutual, it
seems. He appeared to me to be very much
struck with you at first sight, Miss Dupuy, to
judge by his manner.’</p>

<p>Nora turned towards him with a sudden fierceness
and haughtiness that fairly surprised the
easy-going young barrister. ‘Mr Noel,’ she said
in a tone of angry but suppressed indignation,
‘how dare you speak to me so about that negro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">{86}</span>
fellow, sir—how dare you? How dare you
mention him and me in the same breath together?
How dare you presume to joke with me on such
a subject? Don’t speak to me again, pray. You
don’t know what we West Indians are, or you’d
never have ventured to utter such a speech as
that to any woman with a single drop of West
Indian blood in her whole body.’</p>

<p>Harry bowed silently and bit his lip; then,
without another word, he moved back slowly
toward the other group, and allowed Nora to
join Mrs Ord by the door of the companion-ladder.</p>

<p>In twenty minutes more, the first warning bell
rang for those who were going ashore, to get
ready for their departure. There was the usual
hurried leave-taking on every side; there was
the usual amount of shedding of tears; there was
the usual shouting and bawling, and snorting and
puffing; and there was the usual calm indifference
of the ship’s officers, moving up and down
through all the tearful valedictory groups, as
through an ordinary incident of humanity, experienced
regularly every six weeks of a whole
lifetime. As Marian and her mother were taking
their last farewells, Harry Noel ventured once
more timidly to approach Nora Dupuy and
address a few parting words to her in a low
undertone.</p>

<p>‘I’m sorry I offended you unintentionally just
now, Miss Dupuy,’ he said quietly. ‘I thought
the best apology I could offer at the moment
was to say nothing just then in exculpation.
But I really didn’t mean to hurt your feelings,
and I hope we still part friends.’</p>

<p>Nora held out her small hand to him a trifle
reluctantly. ‘As you have the grace to apologise,’
she said, ‘I shall overlook it. Yes, we part
friends, Mr Noel; I have no reason to part
otherwise.’</p>

<p>‘Then there’s no chance for me?’ Harry asked
in a low tone, looking straight into her eyes, with
a searching glance.</p>

<p>‘No chance,’ Nora echoed, dropping her eyes
suddenly, but speaking very decidedly. ‘You
must go now, Mr Noel; the second bell’s ringing.’</p>

<p>Harry took her hand once more, and pressed
it faintly. ‘Good-bye, Miss Dupuy,’ he said—‘good-bye—for
the present. I daresay we shall
meet again before long, some day—in Trinidad.’</p>

<p>‘O no!’ Nora cried in a low voice, as he turned
to leave her. ‘Don’t do that, Mr Noel; don’t
come out to Trinidad. I told you it’d be quite
useless.’</p>

<p>Harry laughed one of his most teasing laughs.
‘My father has property in the West Indies, Miss
Dupuy,’ he answered in his usual voice of light
badinage, paying her out in her own coin; ‘and
I shall probably come over some day to see how
the niggers are getting on upon it—that was all
I meant. Good-bye—good-bye to you.’</p>

<p>But his eyes belied what he said, and Nora
knew they did as she saw him look back a last
farewell from the deck of the retreating little
tender.</p>

<p>‘Any more for the shore—any more for the
shore?’ cried the big sailor who rang the bell.
‘No more.—Then shove off, cap’n’—to the skipper
of the tug-boat.</p>

<p>In another minute, the great anchor was heaved,
and the big screw began to revolve slowly through
the sluggish water. Next moment, the ship
moved from her moorings and was fairly under
weigh. Just as she moved, a boat with a telegraph-boy
on board rowed up rapidly to her side,
and a voice from the boat shouted aloud in a
sailor’s bass: ‘<i>Severn</i>, ahoy!’</p>

<p>‘Ahoy!’ answered the ship’s officer.</p>

<p>‘Passenger aboard by the name of Hawthorn?
We’ve got a telegram for him.’</p>

<p>Edward rushed quickly to the ship’s side, and
answered in his loudest voice: ‘Yes. Here I am.’</p>

<p>‘Passenger aboard by the name of Miss Dupuy?
We’ve got a telegram for her.’</p>

<p>‘This is she,’ Edward answered. ‘How can we
get them?’</p>

<p>‘Lower a bucket,’ the ship’s officer shouted to a
sailor.—‘You can put ’em in that, boy, can’t you?’</p>

<p>The men in the boat caught the bucket, and
fastened in the letters rudely with a stone taken
from the ballast at the bottom. The screw still
continued to revolve as the sailors drew up the
bucket hastily. A little water got over the side
and wet the telegrams; but they were both still
perfectly legible. Edward unfolded his in wondering
silence, while Marian looked tremulously
over his right shoulder. It contained just these
few short words:</p>

<p>‘<i>From</i> <span class="smcap">Hawthorn</span>, <i>Trinidad</i>, to <span class="smcap">Hawthorn</span>,
R.M.S. <i>Severn</i>, <i>Southampton</i>.—For God’s sake, don’t
come out. Reasons by letter.’</p>

<p>Marian gazed at it for a moment in speechless
surprise; then she turned, pale and white, to
her husband beside her. ‘O Edward,’ she cried,
looking up at him with a face of terror, ‘what on
earth can it mean? What on earth can they wish
us not to come out for?’</p>

<p>Edward held the telegram open before his eyes,
gazing at it blankly in inexpressible astonishment.
‘My darling,’ he said, ‘my own darling, I haven’t
the very remotest notion. I can’t imagine why
on earth they should ever wish to keep us away
from them.’</p>

<p>At the same moment, Nora held her own telegram
out to Marian with a little laugh of surprise
and amusement. Marian glanced at it and
read it hastily. It ran as follows:</p>

<p>‘<i>From</i> <span class="smcap">Dupuy</span>, <i>Trinidad</i>, to <span class="smcap">Miss Dupuy</span>, R.M.S.
<i>Severn</i>, <i>Southampton</i>.—Don’t come out till next
steamer. On no account go on board the <i>Severn</i>.’</p>

</div>


<h3 title="PART II.">IN TWO PARTS.—PART II.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Another</span> week has elapsed. The month of May
has arrived in all its glory and beauty. The
magnificent trees in the park of the Diet House
form a leafy arched avenue, and amid the branches
of the venerable six hundred year old yew-tree,
beneath which Mendelssohn composed the overture
to his <i>Midsummer Night’s Dream</i>, feathered
songsters of every kind hold their gay revels.
The spring, that wonderful season of longing
and restless desire, is, as usual, warring successfully
against the stern duties of the members of
parliament. Even the hardest workers among
them, Prince Albrecht of Prussia, Moltke, and
Steinmetz, ay, even those most persevering of
deputies, Wachler and Count Rennard, can no
longer remain indoors. The outcry about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">{87}</span>
bad ventilation of the House is only a pretext
to cover their retreat with honour, and all
gradually assemble beneath the giant yew, there
to listen to the gay tales and rare bits of scandal
with which Hennig and Unruh regale the
assembly. Last year, when, during the intense
heat, we sat out here in the cool <i>pavillon</i>, discussing
the wine duties with the help of some
bottles of rare old Rhenish, President Simson had
a large telegraphic bell placed on the top of the
kiosk, which by its sudden peal so startled our
unconscious souls, like the voice of the last
trumpet, that it completely scared away the god
Bacchus from these precincts for ever.</p>

<p>It was therefore with intense relief that all
looked forward to the legitimate parliamentary
recreation of the week, Prince Bismarck’s Saturday
evening. This time, no constables were
visible. Immediately on entering the first reception
room up-stairs, we saluted his lady, and
were welcomed by Bismarck himself, who at once
entered into conversation with us, only stopping
occasionally to shake hands with some fresh
arrival. The crush gradually began to lessen as
the visitors dispersed into the various rooms. We
were still standing in the anteroom, near the great
sideboard; the moment seemed favourable for
ascertaining the meaning of the stuffed hare; I
therefore asked Bismarck why it was placed there.</p>

<p>‘Oh, have you not noticed that this hare is
brunette?’</p>

<p>‘Brunette?’</p>

<p>‘Yes. Look here—he has a dark-brown head
and back, whereas he ought by rights to be yellow.
I ought to place an ordinary hare beside him to
show off this natural curiosity. He was the only
“brunette” hare among the fifteen hundred we
killed that day.’</p>

<p>Most of the guests had gone to the billiard-room.
There were not so many present on this
Saturday evening; a festival in commemoration of
the foundation of the Law Union had drawn
nearly all the legal celebrities of the House to
Charlottenburg.</p>

<p>But what interested me most was Bismarck’s
own room, the door of which stood open.</p>

<p>‘May one enter?’ I ask of one of the house-servants.</p>

<p>‘Certainly, sir,’ is the reply.</p>

<p>And crossing the threshold, I glance round
the room. In the centre, though somewhat
nearer the two windows that lead on to the
terrace, stands Bismarck’s writing-table, a sort
of long desk, provided on each side with open
pigeon-holes. The chair, without any lean, is a
large round seat of massive oak, which turns either
way. On the right-hand side are the shelves
that hold the public documents. There were none
there now, but on the floor below lay several
locked portfolios. The light falls from the left,
gently softened by white and crimson silk curtains.
Innumerable white gloves, and swords
enough to arm a whole division of generals, are
piled up on a table facing the door through which
we entered. On the escritoire beside it, the Chancellor’s
various civil, military, and official head-coverings
form quite a small exhibition. The
other half of the wall is completely filled up by
a couch of colossal dimensions, covered with blue
brocade. It is almost as broad as it is long, without
back or side cushions, only at the head a
round bolster is placed, on which reposes an embroidered
cushion with this inscription: ‘In
Memory of the Year 1866.’</p>

<p>The pictures on the walls consist of life-size
engravings, portraits of the great <i>Kurfürst</i> Frederick
the Great, Frederick-William III., and
King William. Beside this latter hangs an engraving
of Murillo’s Madonna, looking somewhat
surprised at her worldly companions. Finally,
on the wall behind the writing-table hangs a
charming Swiss cuckoo-clock; while just below
the portrait of Frederick the Great, and so placed
that Bismarck can see it when he reposes on
the couch, hangs a small picture of his mother,
whose memory, as is well known, he treasures
above everything else. Even taken from the
simple stand-point of man to man, it is satisfactory
to find, by the various letters from among his
private papers that have of late years been made
public, such a fund of kindly feeling, such a
bright and hearty nature, as one would hardly
have looked for in this daring and indomitable
combatant.</p>

<p>‘In spite of all the hunting and raking-up
of anecdotes of Bismarck’s past life,’ said a Saxon
deputy, ‘that has been going on now for some
years both by Sunday and week-day sportsmen,
from the big journals down to the tiny pamphlets,
not one half of what he has really done, said,
and written, will ever be collected together;
while those who are at all honest will frankly
admit that it would be impossible to reproduce
faithfully the peculiar form and fresh originality
of his sayings. Thus, I heard rather a characteristic
anecdote of his meeting with Councillor
P——, from the Saxon town of M——, at the
Berlin Railway Station in Leipzig. Bismarck—it
was in 1863—had been with the king in
Carlsbad, and was travelling back to Berlin, viâ
Leipzig, in strict incognito. It was noon, and
there was more than an hour to wait before the
next train started. Our friend Councillor P——,
who had been told by the station-master who
his travelling companion was, went into the
reserved dining saloon—Bismarck did the same—and
soon the two merged into amicable converse,
while discussing their respective luncheons.
Bismarck praised the beauty of Saxony and the
bravery and industry of its people. Councillor
P——, who did not belong to the blind worshippers
of Herr von Beust, asked his <i>vis-à-vis</i>
what he thought of the Saxon government and
policy. His <i>vis-à-vis</i> continued his panegyric.
P——, determined not to be outdone, launched
forth into raptures about Prussia—not, however,
including the Berliners.</p>

<p>“Well, you are quite right,” said Bismarck.
“I daresay you have heard the story of the
Alpine host, who, after pointing out the glories
of his native land, asked a Berlin youth whether
they had such mountains as that in Berlin. ‘No,’
he replied; ‘we have not got such mountains;
but if we <i>had</i>, they would be far finer than these!’
Much the same thing happened to me. I was
living in Hanover for some time, and one day
I went, with a friend from Berlin, along the
beautiful Herrenhauser Allee. ‘Look at those
magnificent trees!’ I said. ‘Where?’ was the
answer, as he looked round with contempt. ‘You
mean <i>these</i>? Why, they are not to be compared
to the Linden of Berlin!’ The following year,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">{88}</span>
I walked with my friend Unter den Linden.
They had their usual summer aspect, which, as
I daresay you all know, is sufficiently dreary
and melancholy. ‘Well, what say you now?’
I asked my companion. ‘Do you still maintain
that this is superior to the Herrenhauser Allee?’
‘Oh, leave me in peace with your Herrenhausers
and Allees,’ he cried testily; ‘it always makes
me savage when I am shown anything better
than we have in Berlin.’ There you have a true
picture of the Berliner.”</p>

<p>‘Bismarck then went on discussing the lower
classes in Berlin, especially the porters, and
lamented that it was found almost impossible
to make them trustworthy. “You should do
the same as we do,” replied the councillor—“swear
the men in before they take service.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” replied Bismarck, laughing, “that would
not hold water with us.”</p>

<p>‘Meanwhile, the doors of the reserved dining-room
were thrown open to the great travelling
public, who began to assemble preparatory to the
starting of the train. Among others, the well-known
Leipzig <i>colporteur</i>, Hartwig, utilised the
moments to find a fresh market for his wares.
He had evidently also another motive—which
he kept out of sight—and that was to give the
Prussian minister some unvarnished truths and
a piece of his mind about his political views,
for of course he knew Bismarck by sight.’</p>

<p>Now first I noticed the gigantic size of the
bearskin that lay beneath the billiard-table—it
is almost as long as the table itself. Bismarck
shot the animal in Russia, after having watched
and waited for it five nights running.</p>

<p>The mighty Nimrod now joined our party,
and leant up against the billiard-table while
talking. He then sat down <i>on</i> the table, and
while keeping up a lively conversation with
Hennig and the rest of us about various points
on the interior economy of the Diet, he every
now and then threw a billiard ball behind him,
so that each time it hit the two others that
were on the table. After the discussion had
lasted some time, Bismarck said: ‘But come,
gentlemen; I think it is time we had some
refreshment.’ So saying, he led the way, and
we again passed through the chamber with the
yellow Gobelins, full of Chinese figures, animals,
and pagodas, on to the dining saloon. On our
way, we passed Deputy Kratz in deep confab
with General von Steinmetz. They were still
continuing the discussion on the theory of light,
with which the worthy judge and the victor
of Trautenau had entertained the House for over
an hour a few days ago.</p>

<p>Close beside them stood the Hessian deputy
Braun, talking to Admiral Jachmann. It is
incredible what an inordinate desire this inland
resident, who has never even heard the sound
of the sea, has for occupying himself with
naval matters. Perhaps these constant discussions
with landsmen, who cannot know much
of nautical affairs, are the cause of the somewhat
stereotyped smile that curves the worthy
admiral’s otherwise handsome lips. This time,
however, he did <i>not</i> smile. Braun had asked
him the following simple but weighty question:
‘The papers and telegraphs have just
informed us of the arrival at Kiel, from England,
of the <i>König Wilhelm</i>, the largest armour-plated
ship of the North German navy. They
write in such a cool, indifferent sort of manner,
as if it were quite an everyday affair for
us to pay out over three million dollars for
such a vessel. Has Your Excellency already
inspected the vessel?’ ‘No; I will do so to-morrow.’
And with this answer the deputy had
to be satisfied.</p>

<p>As I passed on, I again came across Bismarck,
this time in conversation with Albrecht, the
town recorder of Hanover, who in the previous
year had had a sharp tussle about his right to
the ox with which the guild of butchers have,
from time immemorial, every year presented the
recorder. The much-vexed question, <i>re</i> the ox,
was happily not now in dispute, Albrecht having
manfully fought for and gained his cause. But
the point under discussion was evidently nearly
as delicate and intricate, for I heard Bismarck
say: ‘Well, both you and I have lost some hair—we
have therefore <i>one</i> very important point
in common—and ought to understand one another
all the better.’</p>

<p>The table in the dining saloon was again
covered with all the cold delicacies of a true
North German kitchen; and again, like last
Saturday, a small side-table had been taken
possession of by some of the deputies, among
whom I noticed the gentlemanly police superintendent
Devens of Cologne; the two noble sons
of the soil, Evelt and Hosius; and the honest
but somewhat moody Günther of Saxony.</p>

<p>Ere long, Bismarck came up and seated himself
between Devens and Evelt, chatting pleasantly
with them, while enjoying the cool and fragrant
<i>Maitrank</i>.</p>

<p>‘How do you like my <i>Maitrank</i>?’ he asked.</p>

<p>‘It is perfect, Your Excellency!’</p>

<p>‘Yes; I rather pride myself on it. Curiously
enough, during all my student days I never
found any <i>Waldmeister</i> further south than
Heidelberg. Our South German brethren were
first initiated into the delights of the <i>Maitrank</i>
by us northerners. You from Hohenzollern, for
instance, have no <i>Waldmeister</i>, I suppose?’</p>

<p>‘O yes, Your Excellency,’ replied Evelt. ‘It
grows splendidly with us. But I also may lay
claim to the honour of having introduced the
Swabians to its magic powers.’</p>

<p>‘You have to thank your sterile Alps for
that,’ returned Bismarck. ‘Were they more
sheltered, no <i>Waldmeister</i> would grow there.’</p>

<p>A group of deputies and several waiters with
plates and glasses now separated me from the
speakers. When I again rejoined the party,
Bismarck was telling them the following story
of General von Strotha: ‘He was at that time
living quietly at Frankfort, in command of the
allied garrison there, when one day he received
a telegram from the then Minister President,
Count von Brandenburg, to come at once to
Berlin and report himself to the minister.
Strotha starts for Berlin in hot haste, and thence
immediately goes to Brandenburg.</p>

<p>“I have sent for Your Excellency to ask you
to become War Minister,” said Brandenburg.</p>

<p>“Me!” exclaimed Strotha. “For heaven’s
sake, Your Excellency, what made you think of
such a thing? I am not in any way fitted for the
post.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid that can’t be helped. See; here<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">{89}</span>
is the order from His Majesty the king, requiring
that you shall be War Minister.”</p>

<p>‘Strotha reads the order, looking greatly
troubled, and then says: “Of course, if His
Majesty commands, I must obey.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, my dear colleague,” continues
Brandenburg, “you will attend the cabinet
council at ten to-day.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I could not possibly do that.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid you will have to. See; here is
another order from His Majesty, expressly desiring
you to undertake the War Department in the
cabinet.”</p>

<p>“Then I must of course obey,” said the new
War Minister, with a deep sigh of dejection.</p>

<p>‘He is just about to leave, in order to prepare
himself for his presumable maiden speech, when
Brandenburg stops him: “I suppose you know,
general, that you must appear in <i>mufti</i> [plain
clothes] at the council?”</p>

<p>‘Strotha stood speechless with amazement.
This was the finishing stroke. “I have none!”
he at last managed to stammer forth.</p>

<p>“Well, you will have to get yourself some by
ten o’clock—such are the king’s commands.”</p>

<p>“Then of course I must obey,” replied Strotha,
leaving the room in a very crestfallen manner.</p>

<p>‘But he faced his difficulty valiantly. Jumping
into a cab, he drove off to the Mühlendamm,
where all the old Jews congregate; and at ten
o’clock precisely, a strange figure, with an enormously
nigh collar and coat sleeves hanging right
over his hands, was seated at the ministerial table—this
was the new War Minister!’</p>

<p>Günther, who never could hide what he felt,
and who generally looked at the dark side of
most things, had followed the Chancellor’s story
with undisguised amusement. The circle became
every moment more gay and lively.</p>

<p>‘Take care, Günther,’ cried Mosig von Ahrenberg,
holding up his finger in mock-threat; ‘I
see plainly that Bismarck has completely bewitched
you. I shall feel bound to make your
apostasy known to a certain paper in Leipzig.’</p>

<p>Whilst this merry chaff was going on, Bismarck’s
wife and her daughters had come in and
had seated themselves at the table. The conversation
now became more general; and soon after,
as it was getting late, the party broke up. With
a profound bow to the ladies, and a kindly shake
of the hand from our genial host, we took our
departure, well pleased with our second social
evening at the hospitable dwelling of ‘Our
Chancellor.’</p>

<p class="ph3">BY FRED. M. WHITE.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER X.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A cynical</span> writer somewhere observes, that no
man is too rich not to be glad to get a thousand
pounds; and we may therefore assume the joy
of an individual who possesses about as many
pence, in prospect of obtaining possession of that
sum. It was with this kind of joy—not, however,
quite free from incredulity—that Edgar,
when he met Mr Slimm by appointment at his
hotel next day, listened to that gentleman’s renewed
asseverations that there were thousands
of pounds somewhere in that bit of paper which
had been such a mystery to Edgar and his friends.
Mr Slimm was this morning more enthusiastic
than ever on the subject; but Edgar only smiled
in reply, and eyed his cigar with the air of a
connoisseur in the weed. The notion of his possessing
such a sum was decidedly puzzling. His
coolness attracted Mr Slimm’s admiration.</p>

<p>‘I’ve seen a man hanged in the middle of a
comic song,’ that gentleman observed, with an air
of studious reflection; ‘and I guess he was somewhat
frigid. I once saw a man meet a long-lost
brother whom he had given up for dead, and
ask him for a borrowed sovereign, by way of
salutation, and I calculate that was cool; but
for pure solid stoical calmness, you are right there
and blooming.’</p>

<p>‘Had I expressed any perturbation, it would
have been on account of my doubting your sanity,’
Edgar replied. ‘Does it not strike you as a little
strange that a casual acquaintance should discover
a puzzle worth ten thousand pounds to me?’</p>

<p>‘The onexpected always happens; and blessed
things happen swiftly, as great and good things
always do,’ said Slimm sententiously. ‘I haven’t
quite got the touch of them quotations, but the
essence is about consolidated, I calculate.’</p>

<p>‘What a fund of philosophy you have!’</p>

<p>‘You may say that,’ said the American with
some little pride. ‘You see, some years ago I
was down to New Orleans, and I had considerable
fever—fact, I wasn’t out of the house for
months. Reading ain’t much in my line; but
I had to put up with it then. There was a good
library in the house, and at first I used to pick
out the plums; but that wouldn’t do, so I took
’em in alphabetical order. It was a large assortment
of experience to me. First, I’d get Blair
on the <i>Grave</i>, and read that till I was oncertain
whether I was an or’nary man or a desperate bad
one. Then I would hitch on to <i>British Battles</i>,
and get the taste out of my mouth. I reckon
I stored up enough knowledge to ruin an or’nary
digestion. I read a cookery-book once, followed
by a chemistry work. I got mixed there.—But
to return to our muttons, as the Mo’sieus say. I
ain’t joking about that letter, and that’s a fact.’</p>

<p>‘But what can you know about it?’ Edgar
queried, becoming interested, in spite of himself
and his better judgment.</p>

<p>‘Well, you listen, and I’ll tell you.’</p>

<p>Edgar composed himself to listen, excited more
than he cared to show by the impressive air of
his companion, and the absence of that quaint
smile which usually distinguished him; nor could
the younger man fail to notice not only the
change of manner but the change of voice. Mr
Slimm was no longer a rough miner; and his
accent, if not of refinement, was that of cultivation.
Carefully choosing another cigar, and
lighting it with deliberate slowness, each moment
served to raise his companion’s impatience, a consummation
which the astute American doubtless
desired.</p>

<p>‘When I first knew your uncle,’ he said at
length, ‘we were both much younger men, and,
as I have before told you, I saved his life. That
was in the mines. Well, after a time I lost sight
of him, as is generally the case with such
wanderers. After he left the mines, I did not
stay long; for a kind of home-sickness came over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">{90}</span>
me, and I concluded to get away. I determined
to get back and settle down; and for the first
time in my life, the notion of marriage came into
my head. I had not returned long when I met
my fate. Mr Seaton, I will not weary you with
a description of my wife. If ever there was an
angel upon earth—— But no matter; still, it
is always a mystery to my mind what she could
see in a rough uncouth fellow like me. Well,
in course of time we married. I had some money
then; but we decided before the year was out
that it would be best to get some business for
occupation for me. So, after little Amy was
born, we moved West.</p>

<p>‘For five years we lived there in our little paradise,
and two more children came to brighten our
Western home. I was rapidly growing a rich
man, for the country was good, and the fear of
Indians kept more timorous people away. As for
us, we were the best of friends; and the old chief
used to come to my framehouse and nurse little
Amy for hours. I shall never forget that sight.
The dear little one, with her blue eyes and fair
curls, sitting on that stern old man’s knee, playing
with his beads, and not the least afraid; while
the old fellow used to grunt and laugh and get
as near a smile as it is possible for an Indian
to do. But this was not to last. The old chief
died, and a half-breed was appointed in his place.
I never liked that man. There was something
so truculent and vicious in his face, that it was
impossible to like the ruffian. Well, one day he
insulted my wife; she screamed, and I ran to her
assistance. I took in the situation at a glance,
and gave him there and then about the soundest
thrashing a man ever had in his life. He went
away threatening dire vengeance and looking the
deadliest hate; but next morning he came and
apologised in such humble terms—for the scoundrel
spoke English as well as his own tongue—that
I was fain to forget it. Another peaceful
year passed away, and then I was summoned to
New York on business. Without a single care
or anxiety, I left my precious ones behind. I had
done it before, and they were not the least
afraid.</p>

<p>‘One night, when I had completed my business,
and had prepared everything for my start
in the morning, I was strolling aimlessly along
Broadway, when I was hailed by a shout,
accompanied by a hearty slap on the back. I
turned round, and there I saw Charlie Morton.
Mind, I am talking of over twenty years ago,
and I think of him as the dashing, good-natured,
weak Charlie Morton I used to know.—Well, to
resume. Over a quiet smoke, he arranged to
accompany me.</p>

<p>‘It was a glorious morning when we set out,
and our hearts were light and gladsome, and
our spirits as bright as the weather. Was not
I returning to my darlings! We rode on mile
after mile and day after day, till we were within
twelve hours of my house. Then we found,
by unmistakable signs, that the Indians were on
the war-path. This was uncomfortable news for
us; but still I never had an uneasy thought for
the people at home.</p>

<p>‘When the following morning dawned, I rose
with a strange presentiment of coming evil; but
I shook it off, thinking it was the excitement of
returning, for I had never been away from my
wife so long before. It was just about noon
when I thought I saw a solitary figure in the
distance. It was a strange thing to meet a stray
Indian there, and judge of my surprise when I
saw him making towards us! It turned out to
be a deaf and dumb Sioux I employed about the
clearing, and one of the same tribe we were so
friendly with. By his excited state and jaded
appearance, he had travelled far and hurriedly.
When we came up to him, a horrible fear came
over me, for then I saw he was in his war-paint.
Hurriedly, I made signs to him to know if all
was well at home. He shook his head sadly;
and with that composure which always characterises
his race, proceeded to search for something
in his deerskin vest. You can imagine the eagerness
with which I watched him; and when he
produced a note, with what eagerness did I
snatch it out of his hand! Hastily, I read it,
and sank back in my saddle with a sense of
almost painful relief. Apparently, all was well.
The missive was half a sheet of note-paper, or,
more properly, half of half a sheet of paper, containing
some twelve lines, written right across
the paper, with no signature or heading, saying
how anxious she was for my return. I handed
it to Morton with a feeling of delight and thankfulness;
but, to my surprise, as he read it, he
became graver and graver. At last he burst
forth: “Slimm, have you any secret cipher
between yourselves?”</p>

<p>“No,” I replied, somewhat startled at the
question. “Why?”</p>

<p>“Because there is something more here than
meets the eye. You will not mind my saying
so; but the body of this note is almost cold, not
to say frivolous, while words, burning words,
catch my eye here and there. Can you explain
it?”</p>

<p>“Go on!”</p>

<p>‘I hardly knew my own voice, it sounded so
hard and strained.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he mused, twisting the paper in his
supple fingers, “there is more here than meets
the eye. This old messenger is a Sioux; that
tribe is on the war-path, and the chief thoroughly
understands English. An ordinary appeal for
help would be worse than useless, if it fell into
his hands. I perceive this paper is creased, and
creased with method, and the most touching
words are always confined within certain creases.
Now, I will fold this longways, and turn the
paper so; and then fold it thus, and thus. We
are coming to the enigma. Now thus.—No; this
way, and—— Merciful powers!”</p>

<p>‘He almost reeled from his saddle, and I leant
over him with straining eyes and read: “For
God’s sake, hasten. On the war-path. White
Cloud [the chief] has declared.... Hasten to
us.” I stopped to see no more. Mechanically
thrusting the paper into his saddle-bag, Morton
urged me forward; and for some hours we rode
like madmen, spurring our horses till the poor
creatures almost dropped. At last, in the distance
I saw what was my home—a smoking mass
of ruins. In the garden lay my three children—dead;
and not a quarter of a mile away my wife—also
dead!’</p>

<p>The American here stopped, and threw himself
on his face upon the couch where he had been
reclining, his huge frame shaking with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">{91}</span>
violence of his emotion. Edgar watched him
with an infinite pity in his eyes for some moments,
not daring to intrude upon his grief.
Presently, Slimm calmed himself, and raising his
face, said: ‘Wall, my friend, I guess them
statistics are sorter calculated to blight what
the poet calls “love’s young dream.”—Pass the
brandy,’ he continued, with an air of ghastly
cheerfulness.</p>

<p>‘Why did you tell me this?’ Edgar said,
pained and shocked at the recital and its horrible
climax.</p>

<p>‘Well, you see I wanted to convince you of
the truth of my words. I shall never allude to
my story again, and I hope you never will either;
though I dream of it at times.—Your wife’s uncle
kept that paper, and I have not the slightest
doubt that the same plan has been taken as
regards his wealth. I can’t explain it to you
at this moment; but from the description you
have given of his last letter, I have not the
smallest hesitation in saying that it is formed
on the same lines as the fatal note I have told
you of. Charlie Morton was a good fellow,
but he had not the slightest imagination or
originality.’</p>

<p>‘And you really think that paper contains a
secret of importance?’</p>

<p>‘Never doubted it for a moment. Look at
the whole circumstances. Fancy your meeting
me; fancy my knowing your uncle; fancy—— Bah!
It’s clear as mud.’</p>

<p>‘The coincidences are certainly wonderful.’</p>

<p>‘Well, they are a few.—And now,’ said Mr
Slimm, dropping into his most pronounced
Yankee style, ‘let this Adonis truss his points,
freeze onto a clean biled rag, and don his plug-hat,
and we’ll go and interview that inter<i>es</i>tin’
epistle—yes, sir.’</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XI.</h3>

<p>Edgar and his transatlantic companion walked
along Holborn in silence. The former was deeply
immersed in thought; and the American, in spite
of his forced gaiety, had not yet lost all trace
of his late emotion. Presently, they quitted the
busy street and turned into one of the narrow
lanes leading to Queen Square. Arrived at the
house, they were admitted by the grimy diminutive
maid-of-all-work, and slowly ascended the
maze of stairs leading to Edgar’s sitting-room.
There were two persons who looked up as they
entered—Eleanor and Jasper Felix. Edgar performed
the ceremony of introduction, asking his
companion if he had ever heard of the great
novelist. He had.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ said Mr Slimm impressively, ‘I believe
that name has been mentioned in my hearing
once, if not more.—Allow me to shake hands
with you, sir. I ain’t given to worshipping
everybody who writes a ream of nonsense and
calls it a novel; but when I come across men
like you, I want to remember it. We don’t have
many of your stamp across the Atlantic, though
Nathaniel Hawthorne runs you very close.’</p>

<p>‘Indeed, you are very complimentary,’ Felix
replied; ‘and I take your word as flattering. I
don’t like flattery as a rule, especially American
flattery. It is rare, in a general way. I feel
as if they always want something, you know.’</p>

<p>‘Well, I do calculate my countrymen don’t
give much away for nothing. They like a <i>quid
pro quo</i>; and if they can get the <i>quid</i> without
the <i>quo</i>, so much the better are they pleased.
But I didn’t come here to discuss the idiosyncrasies
of my countrymen.’</p>

<p>Mr Slimm seemed to possess the happy knack
of making his conversation suit his company.
Edgar could not help contrasting him now with
the typical Yankee of the gambling-house; they
hardly seemed like the same men.</p>

<p>‘Have you got your uncle’s letter?’ Edgar
asked his wife.</p>

<p>‘Why?’ she asked, without the slightest curiosity.</p>

<p>‘Why? I have almost come to your way of
thinking,’ replied Edgar. ‘Do you know, a
wonderful thing has happened this morning.
To make a long story short, my good friend
here was an old friend of your uncle’s. The
story is a very sad one; but the gist of it is
that the paper your uncle left so nearly resembles
a tragic document which he and Mr Slimm
once perused together—what is termed a cipher—that
he is almost sure it is taken from the
same. The coincidence is so strange, the two
letters are so remarkably alike’——</p>

<p>‘Is this really so, Mr Slimm?’ Eleanor asked
eagerly.</p>

<p>‘Yes, madam,’ he said quietly. ‘Some day
I will tell you the tale, but not now, of how
I came to be in receipt of that terrible document.
Your uncle was with me; and from what I
know of the circumstances, they must be the
same. If you don’t mind me seeing it’——</p>

<p>Before he could finish his sentence, Eleanor
was out of the room, and a silence, an uneasy
silence of expectancy, fell on the group. No one
spoke, and the few minutes she was away seemed
like hours. Then she reappeared, and put the
paper in his hands.</p>

<p>He merely glanced at it for a moment; indeed,
he had not time to read it through before a
smile began to ripple over his quaint-looking,
weather-beaten face. The smile gradually grew
into a laugh, and then he turned to view the
anxious group with a face full of congratulation
and triumph.</p>

<p>‘Have you found it? Is it so?’ burst from
three people simultaneously.</p>

<p>He was provokingly slow in his reply, and his
Yankee drawl was more painfully apparent than
ever. ‘Young man,’ said he to Edgar, ‘what
might have been the nominal value of your
uncle’s estate—if he had any?’</p>

<p>‘About thirty or forty thousand pounds.’</p>

<p>‘And I promised, if you would let me see this
paper, I would show you something worth ten
thousand pounds. Well, you must pardon me
for my little mistake. One can’t always guard
against mistakes, and this paper is worth four
times that amount.’</p>

<p>For a few moments every one was aghast at
the value of the discovery.</p>

<p>Edgar was the first to recover himself. ‘You
are not joking, Slimm?’ he exclaimed hoarsely.</p>

<p>‘Never a bit,’ he replied with a gaiety delicately
intended to cover and arouse the emotion
of the others. ‘There it is on the face of the
paper, as plainly as possible—the fateful words
staring me in the face. You could see them
yourselves, if you only knew how.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">{92}</span></p>

<p>‘Wonderful!’ exclaimed Felix. ‘And that
simple paper contains a secret worth all that
money?’</p>

<p>‘Why, certainly. Not only that, but where
it is, and the exact spot in which it is concealed.
Only to think—a starving, desperate woman
dragging such a secret as that about London;
and only to think of a single moment preventing
it being buried in the Thames. Wonderful,
wonderful!’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps you will disclose it to us,’ said Edgar,
impatient at this philosophical tirade.</p>

<p>‘No!’ Eleanor put in resolutely—‘no, Edgar!
I do not think it would be fair. Considering
the time and trouble Mr Carver has given to
the matter, it would only be right for him to
know at the same time. The dear old gentleman
has been so enthusiastic throughout, and so
kind, that I should feel disappointed if he did
not hear the secret disclosed when we are all
together.’</p>

<p>‘How thoughtful you are, Mrs Seaton!’
remarked Felix with great admiration. ‘Of
course you are right. The old fellow will be
delighted beyond measure, and will fancy he
has a hand in the matter himself.’</p>

<p>‘I do not see why we should wait for that,’
Edgar grumbled.</p>

<p>‘Impatient boy!’ said Eleanor with a charming
smile. ‘Talk about curiosity in woman,
indeed!’</p>

<p>‘All right,’ he replied laughingly, his brow
clearing at one glance from his wife. ‘I suppose
we must wait. I do not see, however, what is
to prevent us starting to see him at once. Probably,
you won’t be more than an hour putting
on your bonnet, Nelly?’</p>

<p>‘I shall be with you in five minutes;’ and,
singular to relate, she was.</p>

<p>‘Curiosity,’ remarked Edgar, ‘is a great stimulus,
even to women.’</p>

<p>Arrived at Bedford Row, they found Mr
Carver at his office, and fortunately disengaged.
It did not take that astute gentleman long to
perceive, from the faces of his visitors, that something
very great and very fortunate had happened.</p>

<p>‘Well, good people,’ he said, cheerfully rubbing
his head with considerable vigour, ‘what news?
Not particularly bad, by the look of you.’</p>

<p>Edgar stated the case briefly, and at the
beginning of his narrative it was plain to see
that the worthy solicitor was somewhat disappointed;
but when he learned they were
nearly as much in the dark as he, he resumed
his usual rubicund aspect.</p>

<p>‘Dear, dear! how fortunate. Wonderful, wonderful!’
he exclaimed, hopping about excitedly.
‘Never heard such a thing in my life—never,
and thirty years in practice too. Quite a hero,
Edgar.’</p>

<p>‘No, sir,’ Edgar put in modestly. ‘Mr Slimm
is the hero. Had it not been for him, we could
never have discovered the hidden mine. Talk
about Aladdin’s lamp!’</p>

<p>‘And so you knew my poor client?’ broke in
Mr Carver, addressing Slimm. ‘What a fine
fellow he was in those days! I suppose you
showed him the secret of the cipher?’</p>

<p>‘Wall, no, stranger,’ replied the American, the
old Adam cropping out again strongly. ‘He
guessed it by instinct, if it wasn’t something
higher’n that. I did not know it myself, though
it was sent to me by one very dear to me, to warn
me of danger. You see, it might have come
into the hands of an enemy who understood
English, and it was just a desperate chance. It
came a trifle late to save my peace of mind,’ he
continued naturally and bitterly, ‘and I shall
never forget it. The sight of that piece of paper
in that lady’s hands,’ pointing to the important
document, ‘gave me a touch of the old feeling
when I first saw it.’</p>

<p>‘Poor fellow, poor fellow! Pray, don’t distress
yourself upon our account. A mere explanation’——</p>

<p>‘I’d almost forgotten,’ replied Mr Slimm,
taking the paper from Eleanor’s hands. ‘If you
will be good enough to listen, I will explain
it.’</p>

<p>They drew close round the table, and he proceeded
to explain.</p>

<p>‘The paper I hold in my hand,’ said the American,
‘is filled with writing, commencing at the
top of the paper, without anything of a margin,
and ending in the same manner. The paper, you
perceive, is ruled with dotted lines, which makes
the task of deciphering the secret all the easier.
It has five dotted perpendicular lines at equal
distances; and four horizontal, not so equal in
distance. These are guide-lines. Now, I will
take the letter and fold it along the centre dotted
line from top to bottom, with the writing inside—so.
Then from the second dotted line, counting
from the right-hand side, I fold it backwards,
showing the writing—thus. Then I fold the
fourth dotted line from the right hand over the
writing. The first part is accomplished by turning
the narrow slip of writing between the fifth
line and the left-hand side back thus; and then
you see this. The rest is simple. Fold the slip
in two, keeping the writing inside; then turn
the bottom portion back and fold it across
the lower dotted line, and the puzzle is complete.
Or there is yet a simpler way. In each
corner of the paper there are a few words
inclosed by the dotted lines. Begin at the top
at the word “Darling,” then across the line to
the words “Nelly, in.” Then the next line,
which is all inclosed at the top in the corner
squares. Read the same way at the bottom corner
squares; and see the result. You are puzzled by
the folding, I see; but try the other way. Here,’
he said, handing the paper to Nelly; ‘please read
aloud what you can make of it.’</p>

<p>Following his instructions, Nelly made out the
words thus:</p>

<table class="autotable">
<tr>
<td class="tdl"><i>Darling</i></td>
<td class="tdl"><i>Nelly, in</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl"><i>the garden</i></td>
<td class="tdl"><i>under the</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl"><i>Niobe</i></td>
<td class="tdl"><i>you will</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl"><i>find my</i></td>
<td class="tdl"><i>money.</i></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The murder was out! The mystery which had
puzzled every one was explained; and after all, it
was so simple! The simplicity of the affair was
its greatest safeguard. It was so simple, so particularly
devoid of intricacy, that it had baffled
them all. Something bewildering and elaborate
they had expected, but nothing like this. Mr
Carver, notwithstanding his joy, looked inexpressibly
foolish. Edgar gave way to his emotion
in mirth. ‘O shade of Edgar Allan Poe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">{93}</span>
what a climax!’ he exclaimed. ‘Was it for
this our worthy friend waded through the abstruse
philosophy of <i>The Purloined Letter</i> and
the intricacies of <i>The Gold Bug</i>? Was it for
this that <i>The Murders in the Rue Morgue</i> and
<i>The Mystery of Marie Roget</i> were committed to
memory?’</p>

<p>‘Be quiet, you young jackanapes!’ exclaimed
Mr Carver testily; and then, seeing the ludicrous
side of the matter, he joined in the younger
man’s mirth with equal heartiness.</p>

<p>‘But why,’ said Eleanor, still serious, and
dwelling upon the mystery—‘why did not uncle
fold the letter in the way he wished it to be
read?’</p>

<p>‘Well, madam,’ Mr Slimm explained, ‘you see
in that case the letter would have adapted itself
to the folds so readily, that, had it fallen into
a stranger’s hand, he would have discovered the
secret at once. Your uncle must have remembered
the letter he founded his upon, and how
easily he discovered that. By folding this paper
in the ordinary way, improper curiosity was
baffled.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I suppose so,’ Eleanor mused. ‘Anyway,
thank heaven, we have solved the mystery, and
we are free at last!’</p>

<p>‘Don’t look so serious, darling,’ Edgar said
brightly. ‘It is all ours now, to do what we
like with. How happy we shall be!’</p>

<p>‘Ahem!’ coughed Mr Bates ominously, the only
remark which, by the way, he had made during
the scene.</p>

<p>‘Bless me, Bates!’ ejaculated Mr Carver in
his abrupt way. ‘Really, I had quite forgotten
you.—Shake hands, Bates! Let me shake hands
with my future partner.’</p>

<p>‘Begging your pardon, sir, I think not. You’—reproachfully—‘seem
to have forgotten the
will. Mr Morton’s last testament left this property
to Miss Wakefield—this money is part of
his estate.’</p>

<p>Mr Carver groaned and sank back in his chair.
It was too true. Mr Morton’s last will devised
his estate to Miss Wakefield, and this treasure
was hers beyond the shadow of a doubt.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_FLOATING_ISLAND_ON_DERWENTWATER">THE FLOATING ISLAND ON DERWENTWATER.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr Ward</span> in his book on the <i>Geology of the
English Lake District</i>, while describing some of
the effects that various rock formations have on
scenery, has stated that the mountains surrounding
Lake Derwentwater are not only geologically
interesting, but are very beautiful. To quote
his own words. He says: ‘If we take our stand
upon Friar’s Crag, jutting out into Derwentwater,
we have before us one of the fairest views that
England can give. The lake, studded with wooded
islets, and surrounded by mountains of varied
form and outline. Upon the west side, the
mountains, most exquisitely grouped together,
have soft outlines and smooth and grassy slopes,
sometimes meeting below to form, as in Newlands
Vale, an inverted arch of marvellous elegance
and grace. These are of Skiddaw slate, which
mostly weathers away in small flakes or pencil-like
pieces, giving rise to a clayey and shaly wash
at the base of the hills. Upon the east side of
the lake and at its head, the case is otherwise;
the mountains have generally rough and hummocky
outlines and steep and craggy sides; whilst
their waste lies below in the shape of rough
tumbled masses, like ruins of a giant castle. These
consist of rocks belonging to the volcanic series,
which are hard, massive, and well jointed. Thus
we have presented to us two independent types
of scenery, formed by very distinct classes of
rock.’</p>

<p>Southey, in a letter to Coleridge, describing
the view from his house (Greta Hall), compared
the mountains of the first type above mentioned
to the ‘tents of a camp of giants;’ whilst it is
between a rift in the rocks of the latter, or
volcanic series, that the Watendlath burn rushes
down and forms the picturesque Falls of Lodore.</p>

<p>But, apart from the varied charms of scenery
surrounding Derwentwater, and the many historical
reminiscences connected with the immediate
neighbourhood, the lake has a phenomenon
of its own in the so-called Floating Island. The
visitor to Keswick may see at any time, and if
such be his desire, may row round and thoroughly
inspect four islands on the lake; but this one,
through its somewhat eccentric movements, is
not so easily examined. In fact, it only exists
as an island for a few weeks’ duration, and then
generally at intervals of several years. The last
time it was visible was in 1884, when it was
noticed about the middle of August; and disappeared
during the first week in October. It
is doubtful whether all the causes of this occurrence
are yet known; for, on its last appearance,
considerable interest was taken in it by scientific
men, and several experiments were made with a
view of ascertaining its substance, both solid and
gaseous. Certain it is that, even in these days
of accurate information and universal reading,
considerable misconception must exist on the
subject. For instance, an article appeared in
this <i>Journal</i> for August 1874, in which it was
stated that ‘until it was driven ashore in a gale,
a few years ago, there used to be an island of
this kind’ [the writer had previously spoken of
a floating island on a Swedish lake, which
occasionally sank below the surface and reappeared]
‘on Derwentwater, Cumberland....
When a stick or fishing-rod was driven through
it, a jet of water would spurt up from the hole;
thus indicating that some spring or current was
pressing against it from below; and this was
probably the force which kept it at the surface,
and being of an intermittent character, allowed
it at times to sink to the bottom.’ This writer’s
idea was, that a waterfall, which he mentions
as ‘throwing itself into the lake,’ but is in
reality at least a quarter of a mile off, caused a
current, which, according to its force, was able
to buoy the island up by its pressure. This
fallacious theory is mentioned in one or two
guide-books to Keswick, one stating that, ‘the
guides, the older and more intelligent ones, will
tell you of a little stream that gets lost in the
ground.’ This ‘little stream’ is the Catgill Beck,
which, in its passage from the hills, forms the
waterfall spoken of in the previous quotation.
The ‘driven ashore in a gale’ statement is easily
refuted by the fact that the island made its
appearance two years after in the same place
as on its previous emergences, namely, about a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">{94}</span>
hundred and fifty yards from the shore at the
south-eastern corner of the lake.</p>

<p>The <i>Daily News</i> of August 20, 1884, contained
a short leading article on the subject, in which,
after describing the floating gardens of the ancient
Mexicans, the writer continues: ‘This at Derwentwater
seems to be merely an accidental accretion
of material round some tree-trunk or something
of the kind, which, as in the larger island
just alluded to [an American one], has become in
some way anchored to the bed of the lake,
probably at that point not very deep.’</p>

<p>The writers of the two articles above quoted
could never have examined, and probably had
never even seen the island in question.</p>

<p>A frequent source of error is the notion people
are liable to carry away who have only seen it
from the shore. Many see it, probably for the
first and only time, from the top of a stagecoach,
on their way to Buttermere or on some other
favourite excursion. Just previously, the driver
has perhaps directed their attention, by a jerk of
his whip over his left shoulder, to Raven’s Crag.
Now, there is a gap in the trees on the other side,
and a glimpse of the lake is caught. ‘Floating
Island,’ laconically remarks Jehu to the box-seat
occupants, and again points his whip, but this
time to the right towards the lake. ‘Where?
where?’ ask the others behind. ‘There, there—don’t
you see?’ and on rolls the coach, some
wondering if that little patch of green were it;
others, failing to see anything, refer to their
guide-books or companions as to what object of
interest must next be looked for. <i>Lodore Hotel</i>
comes into view, and the minds of the hurried
tourists are once more engaged in a hasty examination
of the Falls. So the day wears on, and
they have seen the Floating Island. But how,
and how much? Even the name itself may cause
misapprehension, although it would be difficult to
give the object a more definite appellation.</p>

<p>The island is not mentioned either by Hutchinson
or Nicolson and Burns in their Histories of
Cumberland, published towards the end of last
century. In an interesting account, however, of
<i>A Fortnight’s Ramble to the Lakes</i>, by Jos. Budworth,
F.S.A., published 1795, a short reference
is made to it. After speaking of the ‘stormy
breakers’ on the lake, caused by ‘a bottom wind,’
he goes on to say: ‘It is said Keswick Lake often
wears this appearance a day or two previous to a
storm; and when violently agitated at the bottom,
an island arises, and remains upon the surface
some time.... The grass and the moss are as
green as a meadow, which soon unite and become
consistent. There are very few people in the
neighbourhood who have not been upon it.’ It
is probably to Jonathan Ottley, a native of Keswick,
and a very careful observer, that we owe
the first really authentic account of the island.
In a paper read before the Manchester Literary
and Philosophical Society, and published in their
Transactions for the year 1819, he gives a graphic
description of it, and mentions a newspaper correspondence
having appeared in the <i>Carlisle
Journal</i> some years previous, in which two or
three different theories were propounded by
various writers as to the cause of its emergence.
At the end of this Memoir, a note from John
Dalton—the author of the Atomic Theory, and
a native of Cumberland, although at this time
he had resided in Manchester for some years—explains,
that ‘being at Keswick in 1815, Mr
Ottley and I procured a small quantity of the
gas [from the island], which I found to consist
of equal parts of carburetted hydrogen and
azotic gases, with about six per cent. of carbonic
acid.’ It will be seen from the above that the
island had not escaped the observation of men of
science very early in the present century.</p>

<p>From a distance, it looks like a grass plot floating
on the lake. It is never more than six inches
above the water, but varies considerably in area
in different years. On its last emergence, the
exposed surface was about fifty yards by twelve;
but in 1842 it was upwards of ninety yards long
by twenty broad. It generally makes its appearance
in July, August, or September, and disappears
towards the end of the last month. In
1831, however, it came to the top on the tenth
of June, and remained exposed until the twenty-fourth
of September—the longest period ever
remembered. It has never been seen except in
the summer or autumn months, and then only
after periods of excessive drought and warm
weather; but whether its origin is owing to the
lowness of the water in the lake, or to the high
temperature, or to a combination of both causes, is
still an open question.</p>

<p>The bed of the lake where the island appears
consists of what, were there no lake over it, would
be called a peat-moss, which extends over several
acres. When the water is calm, dark-brown
patches may be seen over the whole of this area,
indicating rents or fissures. The depth of water
is very uniform here, varying from six to eight
feet when the lake is at an average height. The
appearance of the island is caused by a portion of
this peat-moss rising, not bodily, as in a detached
mass, but like a huge blister. It is this peculiar
manner of rising that upsets the preconceived
notions of many visitors, leading some to suppose
that the surface of the lake having become
lowered, through drought or other causes, a portion
of its bed has been laid bare. Although this
peat-moss is capable of considerable distention,
owing to the elasticity of its component parts, it
not unfrequently occurs that a rupture takes place
whilst rising to the surface. In such cases, two
islands are sometimes formed, but more frequently
one part sinks, when a fairly accurate idea may be
formed of the thickness of the peat-moss or substance
of the island. If the second portion, or
part that has remained at the surface, on resuming
its position at the bottom, does not exactly fill the
same space as before, a gap is caused, which
accounts for the apparent dark patches before
mentioned.</p>

<p>The aquatic plants growing on the bed of this
portion of the lake are, when living, all specifically
lighter than water, which may easily be proved by
detaching any of them from the bottom, when
they will be found to rise to the surface. They
grow, wither, and decay, their roots matting
together amidst the finely divided turf, itself the
remains of various mosses, producing what Ottley
aptly calls a ‘congeries of weeds.’ The thickness
of this mass is about six feet, and rests upon a bed
of clay. After a continuance of high temperature,
the air and gas—of which there is always a considerable
amount in such substances—expand.
This expansion is sufficient to reduce the weight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">{95}</span>
of the whole slightly below an equal volume of
water. The water insinuates itself between the
peat-moss and the bed of clay on which it rests,
but to which it is in no way attached, owing to
the roots not being able to penetrate it. The mass
slowly rises, the lighter portion gradually dragging
itself to the surface, although, as has been
previously stated, not absolutely detaching itself
from the rest. After appearing above the level of
the water, the weeds make vigorous growth, which
tends to reduce temporarily the specific gravity of
the whole still more, and to give that emerald
hue to the exposed part which made Budworth
describe it as being ‘as green as a meadow.’ If,
through heavy rainfall, the water-level of the lake
be raised, the island rises and falls with it.
Should low temperature, however, supervene, the
mass loses its buoyancy, and slowly disappears;
once more to sink into obscurity and become part
of the bed of the lake, after having, for a butterfly
existence, basked under the warm August sun as
the Floating Island.</p>

<h3><i>THE RIGHTS OF THE ELDEST SON AND OTHER CHILDREN
OF AN INTESTATE OWNER OF REAL AND
PERSONAL ESTATE.</i></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> persons believe that the eldest son of a
man who has died without leaving a will, or
who in other words dies intestate, is entitled
to the whole of the property, both real and
personal, left by his deceased parent; but this
is an error so far as relates to the personal estate,
and in some cases also in respect of the real
estate. By the common law, which had its origin
in feudal times, the eldest son was entitled to
succeed to the property of his deceased father;
and might be called upon to perform the military
and other duties which were due and accustomed
to be paid in respect of such property
to the immediate feudal superior. Hence the
origin of what is often spoken of as an iniquitous
system of favouritism arbitrarily established by
law. When there were no standing armies, and
the king upon the throne for the time being
had to depend upon the military services of
the barons who had received lands upon condition
of performing such services, while the
barons in turn had to depend upon the persons
to whom they had granted parts of their lands
upon similar conditions, it was of great importance
that there should always be a male possessor
of those lands. If he were an ‘infant’
and incapable of bearing arms, a relative was
appointed guardian of his person and estate
during his minority, and upon this guardian
devolved the duties appertaining to the estate.
But in those days, tenancies for years and other
smaller interests in lands were not held as of
much account, being of small value, and subject
to being forfeited or declared void on various
pretences; whence arises the apparent anomaly,
that leasehold property is personal estate, whatever
may be its value, and therefore distributable
among all the children of an intestate, as will be
explained more fully. A third class of property
is ‘copyhold,’ which is real estate, but in respect
of which the feudal services were of a different
description. Being useful only, and not military,
these services were considered as inferior in
dignity and less honourable than the duties
attached to the possession of freehold property.
The subject of tenures and services is full of
interest, but the exigences of space compel us to
turn away from the tempting theme. It was,
however, necessary to refer thus briefly to the
origin of the present rules of law, in order to
make intelligible the reasons for the distinctions
which still exist.</p>


<p>We have mentioned the common-law rule of
descent of land, and must note two exceptions to
the general rule. By the custom of ‘borough
English,’ which exists at Maldon in Essex, in the
city of Gloucester, and other places, the youngest
instead of the eldest son inherits his father’s
freeholds in case of intestacy. And by the
custom of ‘gavelkind,’ which still applies to most
of the land in Kent, although some has been disgavelled
by private Acts of Parliament, the freeholds
of an intestate are divisible among all the
sons of the deceased in equal shares.</p>

<p>Leaving these customs aside, we propose to
consider the effect of the intestacy of an owner
of freehold and other property who leaves a
family of children surviving him.</p>

<p>In such a case, the widow (if any) would be
entitled to receive one-third of the rents of the
freeholds for her life, that being a provision made
for her by the law under the name of dower.
Dower attaches to all the freehold lands and
hereditaments of which her deceased husband
was the actual owner at the time of his decease,
either in fee-simple or fee-tail; except, in the
latter case, if the entail were limited to the
children of the first wife, the second wife would
not be dowable out of the estate. But this provision,
mercifully made by the law for the widow
of a man who had so far neglected the duty of a
husband as to omit to provide for her by his will,
may be barred in a very peculiar manner. The
right of a widow to dower will be barred if in the
conveyance to her husband, or any deed subsequently
executed by him, there should be a
declaration that she is not to be entitled to dower
out of the property to which such conveyance or
other deed relates. In this way many widows
have been deprived of dower without the knowledge
of their husbands. If the declaration be
contained in the conveyance, the execution thereof
by the husband is not necessary, as he takes the
property subject to the contents of such conveyance.
If in any other deed, probably he signs,
seals, and delivers it without taking the trouble
to read its contents, trusting to his solicitor to see
that the documents are all right. There cannot
be any possible advantage in inserting the declaration
in question, and, in our opinion, any solicitor
who inserts it without express instructions to do
so—which are never given—is guilty of a grave
dereliction of duty towards his client.</p>

<p>Subject to the right of dower, if not barred, and
to any existing mortgages or other charges, the
freehold property of an intestate becomes the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">{96}</span>
property of his eldest son immediately on the
death; and the rents are apportionable according
to the ownership. The proportion of the current
rent down to the actual date of the decease of the
former owner forms part of his personal estate, as
well as all arrears of rent then remaining unpaid.
When the heir first receives any rent, he pays to
his father’s executors so much as belongs to them,
and retains the remainder for his own use,
although he must satisfy prior charges thereout.
Thus, if the father died in the middle of a half-year,
the year’s rents being one thousand pounds,
there being a mortgage of ten thousand pounds
at four per centum per annum, and the widow
being dowable, then, upon receipt of the first
half-year’s rent, five hundred pounds, the mortgagees
would claim two hundred pounds, the
executors one hundred and fifty, the widow fifty,
and the heir would have one hundred for his own
benefit. The next half-year, the mortgagees
would again take two hundred pounds, the widow
one hundred, and the heir two hundred pounds.
This is how the practical working of such a case
is generally managed; but strictly, the widow
might have one-third of the lands set apart for
her own use during her life, in satisfaction of
her right to dower. This, however, is seldom
done, although it used to be the ordinary course.</p>

<p>Copyhold property is more uncertain in its
incidents than freehold, being regulated entirely
by the custom of each manor of which the property
is holden. The three modes of descent
mentioned above may perhaps be considered to
divide the manors in the kingdom almost equally
amongst them. There is an equal diversity
in respect of free-bench, the copyhold equivalent
for dower. In a few manors, the widow is
entitled to the whole of the rents so long as she
remains a widow; in others, she has half; and
in others, two-thirds; while in the remainder, the
proportion is the same as the dower payable
out of freeholds, one-third; although the duration
of the allowance frequently differs, not being
usually for life, as dower, but during widowhood—in
some manors the additional obligation
of chastity being imposed. The heir, whether
the eldest or the youngest son, is subjected to the
same obligations as in respect of freehold; and
if the gavelkind custom applies, each share on a
further intestacy descends to the heirs of the
co-heir. In this way has been illustrated the
disadvantage of any rule of law which makes
real estate divisible. We knew a small copyhold
estate consisting of a cottage and garden, which
became by successive intestacies subdivided into
shares, some of which were worth no more than
two shillings per year each. Only those who
have had practical acquaintance with the management
of land can appreciate the inconvenience
arising from this minute subdivision.</p>

<p>We have already said that leasehold property
is personal estate; and it only remains to explain
the process of distributing the personal estate of
an intestate. Assuming that the deceased was a
widower who left seven grown-up children, and
who was the owner of leasehold houses, money
on mortgage, shares in various railway and other
joint-stock companies, also household furniture
and other movable effects—any one or more
(not exceeding three) of the children might
apply for letters of administration of the personal
estate and effects of the deceased; two sureties
being required to enter into a bond for the due
administration of the personalty. The administrator,
when appointed, would have full power to
sell the houses, shares, furniture, &amp;c., and to call
in the mortgage moneys. Out of the moneys to
be produced thereby, and any other money in
the bank, in the house, or elsewhere, and of any
debts collected and got in, either by means of
actions or otherwise, the administrator would first
pay the funeral expenses and costs of administration,
including sale expenses; next, all debts
which were owing by the intestate at the time
of his decease; and would then divide the clear
residue among all the children of the deceased in
equal shares. If any child had died leaving
lawful issue, the share which he would have
taken if living would be divided equally amongst
his issue. In either case, no distinction would be
made in respect of age or sex. The eldest son
would take the share which fell to him, within
the rule of distributions, whether he had inherited
any real estate from his father or not.
If the intestate left a widow, she would be
entitled to letters of administration, and to retain
one-third of the residue for her own benefit
before the division of the remainder amongst the
children, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Formerly, the shares of personal estate which
passed to children of the deceased were chargeable
with legacy-duty at the rate of one per cent.;
but this does not apply to intestacies in respect of
which letters of administration have been granted
on or since the 1st of June 1881, and on which an
increased rate of probate duty has been paid.
This, however, does not affect the succession duty
in respect of real estate, which is still payable.</p>
